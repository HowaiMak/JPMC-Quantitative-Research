# JPMC Quantitative Research Job Simulation Programme
Conducted and accredited via Forage between July 2024 to Aug 2024
Access program on: https://www.theforage.com/simulations

## Outline
This project is completed under the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Job Simulation.
Each of the "JP_EX $n$ .ipynb" corresponds to the $n$ th task. The Two Excel files "Nat_Gas.csv" and "Task3n4_Loan_Data.csv" are using in Task 1, 2 and Task 3, 4 respectively.
Besides the code and datasets, all the task instructions are also marked down within.

I have also taken a further step in some of the tasks by implementing financial models such as Holt-Winters (time series forecasting) and the Logistic Regression module. Which are relatively "advanced" for the requirements of the tasks
