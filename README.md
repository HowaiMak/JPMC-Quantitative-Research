# JPMC Quantitative Research Job Simulation Programme
Conducted and accredited via Forage between July 2024 to Aug 2024
Access program on: https://www.theforage.com/simulations

## Outline
This project is completed under the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Job Simulation on Forage. There are a total of 4 assigned tasks, including topics in analysing & forecasting, pricing models, credit risk analysis, and FICO scores. Each of the "JP_EX $n$ .ipynb" corresponds to the $n$ th task. The Two Excel files "Nat_Gas.csv" and "Task3n4_Loan_Data.csv" are using in Task 1, 2 and Task 3, 4 respectively.

The course contains various reading materials, which correspond to the daily work of a quant at JPMC. Besides the code and datasets, all the task instructions are available on my public GitHub repository attached below. Besides the code and datasets, all the task instructions are also marked down within.

I have also taken a further step in some of the tasks by implementing financial models such as Holt-Winters (time series forecasting) and the Logistic Regression module. Which are relatively "advanced" for the requirements of the tasks.
